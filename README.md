# BBC Micro:bit Challenge 03 (UWE Bristol - BSc CS)
A simple Morse Code program using integers will be executed on the BBC Micro:bit physical device to execute on two BBC Micro:bit's using radio.

## Program Description
The program chosen for Challenge 03 is the "Morse Code" using radio. It is an intermediate level program and the intended language to be written for Challenge 03 will be in C++ as it was done for challenge 01 and 02. The program will be executed on the BBC Micro:bit physical device once the device is powered on and connected to the computer or a external battery pack. There are two Micro:bit devices involved in this challenge 03. Micro:bit #1 is the sender and Micro:bit #2 is the reciever. Once Micro:bit #1 and Micro:bit #2 is powered on and either Button A or Button B of Micro:bit #1 is pressed, it will use the radio on Micro:bit #1 to transmit an integer to Micro:bit #2 and will be displayed it's screen. 


## Usage
The program is to only be executed on the BBC Micro:bit device. Attempts to execute the C++ source code's hex code intended for this device and Challenge 02 on any other IOT device has the chance of not to execute and probably run in to errors. Log in to Mbed if you wish to edit the .cpp files given in this repository and to maybe compile a new program for yourself online after the Micro:bit device is connected to the computer using a Mico USB to USB cable. Compile the code, download and copy the .hex file on to the device and it will run on start. Remember to keep both devices within a understandable distance (1-5 feet) is recommended.

## Prerequisites
#### 1 - BBC Micro:bit physical device X 2
#### 2 - Computer running either Windows 8-10, currently supported versions of MacOS and Linux
#### 3 - Micro USB to USB cable X 2
#### 4 - Mbed Account with specifications done to execute and edit the source code online (Optional)
#### 5 - External Battery Packs X2
